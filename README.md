## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.8 or newer
-   A MySQL server installed and running
-   Microsoft Edge and the corresponding `msedgedriver`

### 1. Clone the repository

First, clone the project repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MeethCodes/coco-voice-assistant.git
cd coco-voice-assistant
```

### 2. Set up the environment

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows, use
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install all the required Python packages using the `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure the Database

You'll need to set up a MySQL database for user management.
1. Connect to your MySQL server and create a database named coco.
2. Inside the coco database, create a table named users with the following schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    username VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);
```

3. Update the database connection details (host, user, password, port) in the `cococheckdb.py`, `cocodbconnect.py`, and `cocoindb.py` files to match your MySQL configuration.

### 5. Run the Application

Once the setup is complete, you can start the voice assistant by running the `main.py` script.

```bash
python main.py
```

Say "Coco" to activate the assistant, and then provide your commands. Enjoy your new voice assistant! ðŸš€
